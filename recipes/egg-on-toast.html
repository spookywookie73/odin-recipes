    <h3>Golden Scrambled egg on thick sliced Toast</h3>
    <p>Use large free-range eggs together with a thick slice of crusty bread.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>1 Thick Slice of Crusty Bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Break both eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt
         and pepper and mix together with a fork until golden.
      </li>
      <li>If not already sliced, cut a thick slice of bread.</li>
      <li>Toast your bread under the grill until it is a medium 
        dark brown colour. Only toast one side.
      </li>
      <li>While the bread is toasting, melt some butter in a pan 
        and then add the eggs. Once the eggs start to cook, use a 
        spatula to pull the eggs from the edges of the pan towards
        the middle.
      </li>
      <li>If your bread is toasted enough, place it on a plate and
         spread butter over it. Put it to one side.
      </li>
      <li>Keep mixing the eggs together, breaking up any large portions
         of egg. Keep doing this for a few minutes until the eggs look
         soft but not runny.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the contents of the pan over your toast. Sprinkle a 
        pinch of salt over the eggs and enjoy a delicious meal.
      </li>
    </ol>
