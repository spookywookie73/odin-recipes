    <h4>Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a medium sized bowl and clean it.</li>
      <li>Pick up your closed box of Cereal and shake it gently 
        to cover each individual piece of crunchy goodness in the 
        loose sugar dust.
      </li>
      <li>Open the box and fill your bowl only halfway with the Cereal.</li>
      <li>From about six or seven inches above the bowl, start to pour
         the milk slowly, making sure to hit every part of cereal on top. 
         Stop pouring when the milk is showing through the top layer.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle sugar on top and get ready to make your face a wet, milky mess.</li>
    </ol>
